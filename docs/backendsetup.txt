This tutorial will help you install git, python, django, and everything needed
to develop for the iFiltr backend. This will not install the nifty tools that
are needed for CSS development.

Assume that all installations you should choose default settings unless otherwise specified.

1.) Install python 2.7. This can be found at http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.msi
    -make sure that you install the 32 bit version to c:\python27\
2.) Install easy_install from https://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/s/setuptools/setuptools-0.6c11.win32-py2.7.exe
3.) Install the github client from http://github-windows.s3.amazonaws.com/GitHubSetup.exe
4.) Go to github.com and create an account. After, request access to the ifiltr-backend repo.
5.) Open up the github client(type github into start) and clone the iFiltr-backend repository to
    your harddrive
6.) open up a cmd window and run the following command
    setx path "%pPATH%;C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts\"
    *if you used a different installation path for python make sure you replace that from the command above
7.) restart the terminal window
8.) figure out the directory that the github client was cloned to
    -a sample one is "c:\Users\Me\Documents\GitHub\iFiltr-backend"
    -you directory may be something similar to the above directory
9.) from a cmd window run "cd pathtoifiltr" where pathtoifiltr is the path you just found
10.) run "easy_install pip"
11.) run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
12.) run "python populateDb.py"
13.) run "python manage.py syncdb" say no to creating a superuser
14.) run "python manage.py runserver"
15.) if everything went as planned you should be able to go to 127.0.0.1:8000 in an internet browser
 and see the local ifiltr site. Any local changes will get automatically reflected in the local site

Next Steps:
1.) If you are unfamiliar with python you should learn it. 
    http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python is a fantastic place to start
2.) If you are unfamiliar with django https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/intro/tutorial01/
 is a fantastic tutorial and will take you through a lot of things you'll need to know
 to develop for ifiltr
3.) This one is not as necessary for backend development but learning a bit of javascript
 is not a bad idea. It'll actually be really useful especially for learning the request/response
 pattern that is used anywhere on the web. I found http://eloquentjavascript.net/ to be awesome.
